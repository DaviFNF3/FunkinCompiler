# FunkinCompiler
This compiler converts Friday Night Funkin' (FNF) source code and 
resources into a ready-to-use executable build. It organizes custom 
scripts, sprites, sounds, and other assets, generating a standalone
version of the game that can be distributed and played without the
need for a development environment.

BUILD 1.0 (BETA) - 2024
